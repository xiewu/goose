Combine them into one array of items with:\n  { id, title, url, published_at, type }\n  \n  ### STEP 2: Check What\'s New\n  For EACH item in your combined array:\n  - Call contentfetcher__isNewContent with { id, type }\n  - It returns { is_new: true/false }\n  - Build a list of items where is_new == true\n  \n  ### STEP 3: Decide What to Post\n  \n  **IF you found NEW content:**\n  - Pick the MOST RECENT new item (by published_at date)\n  - Use that item for posting\n  \n  **IF NO new content exists:**\n  - Load the file /Users/ebonyl/.config/goose/evergreen.json\n  - Parse the JSON array\n  - Randomly select ONE item from the array\n  - Use that item for posting\n  \n  ### STEP 4: Generate Platform-Specific Captions\n  \n  For the selected item, create 3 captions following these rules:\n  \n  #### EBONY\'S TONE (ALL PLATFORMS):\n  - Confident, warm, developer-focused\n  - NO hype language (never: "revolutionary", "unlock", "cutting-edge", "game-changer", "transform")\n  - NO cringe marketing speak ("leverage", "synergy", "disrupt")\n  - Short, clear sentences\n  - 0-1 emoji maximum (\u2728 only, if any)\n  - Never more than 1 exclamation point per post\n  - Sound calm, resourceful, dev-first\n  - Highlight what developers will LEARN or BUILD, not hype\n  - Never use generic AI clich\xe9s ("fast-paced world", "stay ahead of the curve")\n  - NEVER use em dashes (\u2014) at all\n  - Focus on practical value and real use cases\n  - Be conversational but professional\n  \n  #### LINKEDIN RULES:\n  - NEVER post YouTube links (heavily penalized by LinkedIn algorithm)\n  - For videos: MUST use native video upload\n  - Tone: calm, clear, slightly longer is OK (but still concise)\n  - No more than 1 emoji\n  - NO hashtags\n  - Focus on professional learning value\n  - Can be 2-3 sentences\n  \n  #### TWITTER/X RULES:\n  - NEVER post YouTube links (penalized)\n  - For videos: MUST use native video upload\n  - Short and punchy (under 280 chars ideal)\n  - No corporate tone\n  - 0-1 emoji max\n  - If thread needed: max 2 tweets\n  - Conversational but professional\n  - Get to the point fast\n  \n  #### BLUESKY RULES:\n  - Links ARE allowed (YouTube links OK here)\n  - Most conversational and casual\n  - Emojis allowed if on-brand (still max 1)\n  - For videos: prefer native upload but link is acceptable\n  - Can be slightly more playful than other platforms\n  - Community-focused tone\n  \n  #### MEDIA HANDLING BY CONTENT TYPE:\n  \n  **If type == "video" (YouTube content):**\n  \n  CRITICAL: YouTube URLs cannot be uploaded as native media to Sprout.\n  You MUST handle each platform differently:\n  \n  - **LinkedIn:** \n    \u2022 DO NOT include YouTube URL in caption (penalized)\n    \u2022 DO NOT pass media_url (cannot upload YouTube natively)\n    \u2022 Caption should describe the video content\n    \u2022 Say something like "Watch the full video on YouTube" WITHOUT the link\n    \u2022 media_url: omit or empty string ""\n  \n  - **Twitter:**\n    \u2022 DO NOT include YouTube URL in caption (penalized)\n    \u2022 DO NOT pass media_url (cannot upload YouTube natively)\n    \u2022 Caption should describe the video content\n    \u2022 Say something like "Full video on YouTube" WITHOUT the link\n    \u2022 media_url: omit or empty string ""\n  \n  - **Bluesky:**\n    \u2022 Links ARE allowed here\n    \u2022 Include the YouTube URL directly in the caption text\n    \u2022 DO NOT pass media_url (cannot upload YouTube natively)\n    \u2022 Caption should include the YouTube link\n    \u2022 media_url: omit or empty string ""\n  \n  **If type == "blog":**\n  - LinkedIn: include blog URL in caption text, no media_url\n  - Twitter: include blog URL in caption text, no media_url\n  - Bluesky: include blog URL in caption text, no media_url\n  \n  **If type == "release":**\n  - LinkedIn: include release URL in caption text, no media_url\n  - Twitter: include release URL in caption text, no media_url\n  - Bluesky: include release URL in caption text, no media_url\n  \n  **IMPORTANT:** The sproutsocialmedia__createPostFromContent tool will:\n  - Upload media natively IF you provide a direct media file URL (MP4, JPG, PNG, etc.)\n  - YouTube URLs are NOT direct media files and cannot be uploaded\n  - For YouTube videos, you must rely on caption text only (with link on Bluesky)\n  \n  ### STEP 5: Get Sprout Profile IDs\n  \n  Call sproutsocialmedia__getConfiguredProfiles to get the profile IDs.\n  This returns:\n  {\n    linkedin_company: "<id>",\n    twitter: "<id>",\n    youtube: "<id>",\n    bluesky: "<id>"\n  }\n  \n  ### STEP 6: Create Sprout Drafts\n  \n  For EACH platform (linkedin, twitter, bluesky):\n  \n  Call sproutsocialmedia__createPostFromContent with:\n  - caption: the platform-specific caption you generated (with URL in text if appropriate)\n  - customer_profile_ids: [<the numeric profile ID for this platform>]\n    \u2022 LinkedIn \u2192 use linkedin_company ID\n    \u2022 Twitter \u2192 use twitter ID\n    \u2022 Bluesky \u2192 use bluesky ID\n  - media_url: ONLY if you have a direct media file URL (MP4, JPG, PNG, etc.)\n    \u2022 For YouTube videos: DO NOT pass media_url (cannot upload YouTube URLs)\n    \u2022 For blog posts: DO NOT pass media_url\n    \u2022 For releases: DO NOT pass media_url\n  - media_type: ONLY if you passed media_url\n    \u2022 "VIDEO" for video files\n    \u2022 "PHOTO" for image files\n  - schedule_time: omit (creates draft, not scheduled)\n  \n  The MCP server will:\n  - Upload media natively if media_url is a direct file URL\n  - Create draft posts in Sprout\n  - Return success confirmation\n  \n  REMEMBER: For YouTube videos, the link goes IN THE CAPTION TEXT (Bluesky only), \n  NOT as media_url!\n  \n  ### STEP 7: Mark as Seen\n  \n  **IF the item was NEW content (not evergreen):**\n  - Call contentfetcher__markContentSeen with { id, type }\n  - This updates ~/.config/goose/content-fetcher-mcp/last_seen.json\n  \n  **IF the item was EVERGREEN:**\n  - DO NOT mark as seen (so it can be reused in the future)\n  \n  ### STEP 8: Summary\n  \n  Report what you posted:\n  - Item title and type\n  - Whether it was new or evergreen\n  - Which platforms received posts (LinkedIn, Twitter, Bluesky)\n  - Any errors encountered\n  - Confirmation that item was marked as seen (if applicable)\n\nprompt: |\n  Begin today\'s scheduled social automation.
