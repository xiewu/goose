Content Ideas Generator (Used 5 times)"\r\n    - Brief description: "Generate ideas for blog posts, videos, workshops"\r\n    - Parameters needed: content_type, topic_area, number_of_ideas\r\n    - Sensitive data warnings if detected\r\n  - Then present USER CHOICE patterns similarly\r\n  - User can select by numbers: "1,3,5,7" or "all" or "none"\r\n  \r\n  ### Batch File Mode:\r\n  - Generate a markdown summary file: "cookbook_review.md" in recipe_output_dir\r\n  - Include all patterns with checkboxes: "- [ ] Content Ideas Generator..."\r\n  - User edits file to check desired patterns\r\n  - User tells you when ready to proceed\r\n  \r\n  ## Step 4: Recipe Generation with Subagents\r\n  - For each confirmed pattern, launch a subagent to generate the recipe\r\n  - Each subagent gets context about:\r\n    - The specific workflow pattern\r\n    - Example sessions that match the pattern\r\n    - Suggested parameters and their default values\r\n    - Organization preference for naming/structure\r\n  - Subagents work in parallel to generate recipes faster\r\n  - Each recipe includes:\r\n    - Proper goose YAML format with version, title, description\r\n    - Parameterized prompts using minijinja templating\r\n    - Comprehensive instructions for headless mode\r\n    - Custom metadata: cookbook_generator_metadata with source info\r\n  - Generate subrecipes when workflows share common patterns\r\n  - Ensure unique naming and handle subrecipe dependencies\r\n  \r\n  ## Step 5: Testing and Finalization\r\n  - If include_test_mode is true:\r\n    - Validate each generated recipe against recent matching sessions\r\n    - Report any recipes that might not work as expected\r\n  - Organize recipes according to organization_preference:\r\n    - flat: All recipes in recipe_output_dir\r\n    - by_category: Create subdirectories by workflow type\r\n    - by_date: Organize by when patterns were first detected\r\n    - by_frequency: Most frequent patterns in priority folders\r\n  - Save analysis metadata to cookbook_analysis.json for incremental runs\r\n  - Update last-run timestamp\r\n  - Generate comprehensive README.md with:\r\n    - Summary of generated recipes\r\n    - Usage instructions\r\n    - Parameter explanations\r\n    - Tips for customization\r\n  \r\n  ## Advanced Guidelines:\r\n  - SMART PATTERN DETECTION: Use LLM intelligence to find semantic patterns, not just keyword matching\r\n  - PARAMETER INTELLIGENCE: Suggest default values based on most common values in sessions\r\n  - SUBRECIPE OPPORTUNITIES: Identify shared workflow components for reusability\r\n  - INCREMENTAL LEARNING: On subsequent runs, suggest updates to existing recipes\r\n  - TOKEN EFFICIENCY: Summarize large sessions, focus on key patterns, batch similar analyses\r\n  - CROSS-SESSION LEARNING: Weight patterns higher if they appear across different time periods\r\n  - SENSITIVE DATA HANDLING: Detect API keys, file paths, personal info - warn but let user decide\r\n  - RECIPE QUALITY: Ensure recipes are actionable, well-parameterized, and genuinely useful\r\n  \r\n  ## Pattern Recognition Intelligence:\r\n  - Look for linguistic patterns: "give me X ideas", "help me outline", "research and summarize"\r\n  - Detect workflow stages: ideation \u2192 planning \u2192 creation \u2192 refinement\r\n  - Identify content domains from session content (don\'t assume specific domains)\r\n  - Recognize tool usage signatures that indicate reusable processes\r\n  - Find parameter opportunities in repeated values (paths, URLs, content types)\r\n  - Distinguish setup tasks (one-time) from creative/analytical processes (repetitive)\r\n\r\nextensions:\r\n  - type: builtin\r\n    name: developer\r\n  -
