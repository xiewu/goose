## Example Usage

When creating my [GitHub Personal Access Token](https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens), I gave it the following access:
* Repository: [goose-demo](https://github.com/angiejones/goose-demo)
* Read access to metadata
* Read and Write access to code, commit status, issues, and pull requests

### goose Prompt
```
create a new branch called hello-world in my angiejones/goose-demo repository. Update the README.md file to say "this was written by goose" and commit it. Open a pull request with your changes.
```

### goose Output

```
I'll help you create a new branch, update the README, and open a pull request. Let me break this down into steps:

1. First, let's create the new branch called "hello-world" in your repository
2. Then update the README.md file
3. Finally, create a pull request

Let me execute these steps:

1. Creating the new branch:

─── create_branch | github ──────────────────────────
branch: hello-world
owner: angiejones
repo: goose-demo

2. Now, updating the README.md file in the new branch:

─── create_or_update_file | github ──────────────────────────
branch: hello-world
content: this was written by goose
message: Update README.md with goose message
owner: angiejones
path: README.md
repo: goose-demo

3. Finally, creating the pull request:

─── create_pull_request | github ──────────────────────────
base: main
body: ...
head: hello-world
owner: angiejones
repo: goose-demo
title: Update README.md

Great! I've completed all the requested tasks:
1. Created a new branch called "hello-world"
2. Updated the README.md file with the text "this was written by goose"
3. Created a pull request to merge these changes into the main branch

You can view the pull request at: https://github.com/angiejones/goose-demo/pull/1

The pull request is now ready for your review. Would you like me to do anything else with it?
