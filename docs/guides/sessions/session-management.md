A session is a single, continuous interaction between you and goose, providing a space to ask questions and prompt action. This guide covers how to manage the session lifecycle.

## Start Session 

:::info First-time setup
In your first session, goose prompts you to [set up an LLM (Large Language Model) provider](/docs/getting-started/installation#set-llm-provider).
:::

<Tabs groupId="interface">
    <TabItem value="ui" label="goose Desktop" default>
        When you open goose, you'll see the session interface ready for use. Just type&mdash;[or speak](/docs/guides/sessions/in-session-actions#voice-dictation "Learn how to enable voice dictation")&mdash;your questions, requests, or instructions directly into the input field, and goose will immediately get to work. 
        
        When you're ready to work on a new task, you can start a new session in the same directory or a different one. This directory is where goose reads and writes files by default.

        <Tabs>
          <TabItem value="same-directory" label="Same Directory" default>

            To start a session in the same goose window:
            1. Click the <PanelLeft className="inline" size={16} /> button in the top-left to open the sidebar
            2. Click `Home` in the sidebar
            3. Send your first prompt from the chat box

            To start a session in a new goose window:
            1. Click the <AppWindow className="inline" size={16} /> button in the top-left
            2. In the new goose window, send your first prompt from the chat box

          </TabItem>
          <TabItem value="diff-directory" label="Different Directory">

            1. Click the <FolderDot className="inline" size={16} /> directory switcher at the bottom of the app
            2. Navigate to the new directory or create a new folder
            3. Click `Open` to open a new goose window for the selected directory
            4. Send your first prompt from the chat box

          </TabItem>
        </Tabs>

        :::tip
        On macOS, you can use the goose dock icon to quickly start sessions:
            - **Drag and drop** a folder onto the goose icon to open a new session in that directory
            - **Right-click** the goose icon and select `New Window` to open a new session in your most recent directory
        :::

        You can also use keyboard shortcuts to start a new session or manage goose windows.
        
        | Action | macOS | Windows/Linux |
        |--------|-------|---------------|
        | New Session with [Quick Launcher](#quick-launcher) | `Cmd+Option+Shift+G` | `Ctrl+Alt+Shift+G` |
        | New Session in Current Directory | `Cmd+N` | `Ctrl+N` |
        | New Session in Current Directory (Same Window) | `Cmd+T` | `Ctrl+T` |
        | New Session in Different Directory | `Cmd+O` | `Ctrl+O` |
        | Toggle Sidebar | `Cmd+B` | `Ctrl+B` |
        | Open Settings | `Cmd+,` | `Ctrl+,` |
        | Keep goose Window Always on Top | `Cmd+Shift+T` | `Ctrl+Shift+T` |
        
        <br />
        #### Quick Launcher
        Start a new session by typing your prompt into a popup:
        1. Press `Cmd+Option+Shift+G` (macOS) or `Ctrl+Alt+Shift+G` (Windows/Linux) to open the popup
        2. Type your prompt and press `Enter`

        The session opens to your most recently opened directory in a new goose window.

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="cli" label="goose CLI">
        From your terminal, navigate to the directory from which you'd like to start, and run the [session](/docs/guides/goose-cli-commands#session-options) command:
        ```sh
        goose session 
        ```

        If you want to interact with goose in a web-based chat interface, start a session with the [`web`](/docs/guides/goose-cli-commands#web) command:
        ```sh
        goose web --open
        ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Name Session
<Tabs groupId="interface">
    <TabItem value="ui" label="goose Desktop" default>
        In the Desktop app, session tiles display auto-generated descriptions based on the context of your initial prompt.

        You can edit session descriptions after they're created:

        1. Click the <PanelLeft className="inline" size={16} /> button in the top-left to open the sidebar
        2. Click `History` in the sidebar
        3. Hover over the session you'd like to rename
        4. Click the <Edit2 className="inline" size={16} /> button that appears on the session card
        5. In the "Edit Session Description" modal that opens:
           - Enter your new session description (up to 200 characters)
           - Press `Enter` to save or `Escape` to cancel
           - Or click the `Save` or `Cancel` buttons
        6. A success toast notification will confirm the change

        :::tip
        Session descriptions help you manage multiple goose windows. When you're in the goose chat interface, session descriptions appear in the `Window` menu and in the Dock (macOS) or taskbar (Windows) menu, making it easy to identify and switch between different goose sessions.
        ::: 

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="cli" label="goose CLI">
        By default, goose names your session using the current timestamp in the format `YYYYMMDD_<COUNT>`. If you'd like to provide a specific name, this is where you'd do so. For example to name your session `react-migration`, you would run:

        ```
        goose session -n react-migration
        ```

        You'll know your session has started when your terminal looks similar to the following:

        ```
        starting session | provider: openai model: gpt-4o
        session id: react-migration
        working directory: /path/to/your/project
        ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Exit Session
Note that sessions are automatically saved when you exit.
<Tabs groupId="interface">
    <TabItem value="ui" label="goose Desktop" default>
    To exit a session, simply close the application.
    </TabItem>    
    <TabItem value="cli" label="goose CLI">
        To exit a session, type `exit`. Alternatively, you exit the session by holding down `Ctrl+C`.

        Your session will be stored in the local SQLite database at `~/.local/share/goose/sessions/sessions.db`.
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Search Sessions

Search allows you to find specific content within sessions or find specific sessions.

<Tabs groupId="interface">
  <TabItem value="ui" label="goose Desktop" default>

    You can use keyboard shortcuts and search bar buttons to search sessions in goose Desktop.

    | Action | macOS | Windows/Linux |
    |--------|-------|---------------|
    | Open Search | `Cmd+F`  | `Ctrl+F`  |
    | Next Match | `Cmd+G` or `↓` | `Ctrl+G` or `↓` |
    | Previous Match | `Shift+Cmd+G` or `↑` | `Shift+Ctrl+G` or `↑` |
    | Use Selection for Find | `Cmd+E` | n/a |
    | Toggle Case-Sensitivity | `Aa` | `Aa` |
    | Close Search | `Esc` or `X` | `Esc` or `X` |

    The following scenarios are supported:

    #### Search Within Current Session
    
    To find specific content within your current session:

    1. Use `Cmd+F` to open the search bar
    2. Enter your search term
    3. Use shortcuts and search bar buttons to navigate the results

    #### Search For Session By Name or Path
    
    To search all your sessions by name or working directory path:

    1. Click the <PanelLeft className="inline" size={16} /> button in the top-left to open the sidebar
    2. Click `History` in the sidebar
    3. Use `Cmd+F` to open the search bar
    4. Enter your search term
    5. Use keyboard shortcuts and search bar buttons to navigate the results (`Cmd+E` not supported)

    This is a metadata-only search. It doesn't search conversation content. Note that searching by session ID (e.g. `20251108_1`) is supported, but this property isn't displayed in the UI.

    :::tip
    You can [rename sessions](#name-session) to give them descriptive names that you'll remember later.
    :::

    #### Search Across All Session Content
    
    To search conversation content across all your sessions, ask goose directly in any chat session. For example:

    - "Find my earlier conversation about React hooks from last week"
    - "Show me sessions where I worked on database migrations"

    goose will search your session history and show relevant conversations with context from matching sessions. 
    
    :::info
    This functionality requires the built-in [Chatrecall extension](/docs/mcp/chatrecall-mcp) to be enabled.
    :::

    #### Search Within Historical Session
    
    To find specific content within a historical session:

    1. Click the <PanelLeft className="inline" size={16} /> button in the top-left to open the sidebar
    2. Click `History` in the sidebar
    3. Click a specific session tile from the list to view its content
    4. Use `Cmd+F` to open the search bar
    5. Enter your search term
    6. Use keyboard shortcuts and search bar buttons to navigate the results

    :::info No Regex or operator support
    Using regular expressions or search operators in search text isn't supported.
    :::

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="cli" label="goose CLI">

    #### Search Within Current Session

    Search functionality is provided by your terminal interface. Use the appropriate shortcut for your environment:

    | Terminal | Operating System | Shortcut |
    |----------|-----------------|-----------|
    | iTerm2 | macOS | `Cmd+F` |
    | Terminal.app | macOS | `Cmd+F` |
    | Windows Terminal | Windows | `Ctrl+F` |
    | Linux Terminal | Linux | `Ctrl+F` |

    To find specific content within your current session:

    1. Use the shortcut to open the search bar
    2. Enter your search term
    3. Use shortcuts and search bar buttons to navigate the results

    :::info
    Your specific terminal emulator may use a different keyboard shortcut. Check your terminal's documentation or settings for the search command.
    :::

    #### Search Across All Session Content
    
    To search conversation content across all your sessions, start a goose session and ask directly:

    - "Find my earlier conversation about React hooks from last week"
    - "Show me sessions where I worked on database migrations"

    goose will search your session history and show relevant conversations with context from matching sessions.
    
    :::info
    This functionality requires the built-in [Chatrecall extension](/docs/mcp/chatrecall-mcp) to be enabled.
    :::

    #### Search Session Data Directly
    
    The [`session list`](/docs/guides/goose-cli-commands#session-list-options) subcommand with supported options can be useful for some search operations.

    You can also query the SQLite database directly:

    ```bash
    # Search session descriptions
    sqlite3 ~/.local/share/goose/sessions/sessions.db \
      "SELECT id, description FROM sessions WHERE description LIKE '%your search term%';"

    # Search by working directory
    sqlite3 ~/.local/share/goose/sessions/sessions.db \
      "SELECT id, description, working_dir FROM sessions WHERE working_dir LIKE '%project-name%';"

    # List recent sessions
    sqlite3 ~/.local/share/goose/sessions/sessions.db \
      "SELECT id, description, created_at FROM sessions ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10;"
    ```

    :::info Session Storage Migration
    Starting with version 1.10.0, goose uses a SQLite database (`sessions.db`) instead of individual `.jsonl` files. Legacy `.jsonl` files remain on disk but are no longer managed by goose.

    :::

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="cli" label="goose CLI">
        To resume your latest session, you can run the following command:

        ```
         goose session -r
        ```

        To resume a specific session, run the following command: 

        ```
        goose session -r --name <name>
        ```
        For example, to resume the session named `react-migration`, you would run:

        ```
        goose session -r --name react-migration
        ```

        :::tip
        While you can resume sessions using the commands above, we recommend creating new sessions for new tasks to reduce the chance of [doom spiraling](/docs/troubleshooting/known-issues#stuck-in-a-loop-or-unresponsive).
