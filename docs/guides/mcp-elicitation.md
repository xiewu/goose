MCP Elicitation allows goose to pause and ask you for specific information when an extension needs it. Instead of guessing or making assumptions, goose presents a form requesting exactly what's needed to continue.

This feature is automatically enabled in goose. When an extension that supports elicitation needs information from you, a form will appear in your session.

## How MCP Elicitation Works

When an extension needs information, goose pauses and presents a form for you to fill out. You can submit your response or cancel the request.

<Tabs groupId="interface">
  <TabItem value="ui" label="goose Desktop" default>

    A form appears inline in the chat with:
    - Fields for the requested data
    - Required fields marked with an asterisk (*)
    - Default values you can accept or change
    - A **Submit** button to send your response

    After submitting, you'll see a confirmation message.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="cli" label="goose CLI">

    A prompt appears in your terminal with:
    - A message explaining what information is needed (in cyan)
    - Field names (in yellow) with descriptions
    - Required fields marked with a red asterisk (*)
    - Default values shown in brackets, e.g., `[default]`

    Type your response for each field and press Enter. For yes/no questions, you'll see an interactive toggle.

    To cancel the request, press `Ctrl+C`.

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::info Timeout
Elicitation requests timeout after 5 minutes. If you don't respond in time, the request is cancelled and goose will continue without the information.
