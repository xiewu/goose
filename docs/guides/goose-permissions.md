goose’s permissions determine how much autonomy it has when modifying files, using extensions, and performing automated actions. By selecting a permission mode, you have full control over how goose interacts with your development environment.

## Permission Modes

| Mode | Description | Best For |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Completely Autonomous** | goose can modify files, use extensions, and delete files **without requiring approval** | Users who want **full automation** and seamless integration into their workflow |
| **Manual Approval** | goose **asks for confirmation** before using any tools or extensions (supports granular [tool permissions](/docs/guides/managing-tools/tool-permissions)) | Users who want to **review and approve** every change and tool usage |
| **Smart Approval** | goose uses a risk-based approach to **automatically approve low-risk actions** and **flag others** for approval (supports granular [tool permissions](/docs/guides/managing-tools/tool-permissions))  | Users who want a **balanced mix of autonomy and oversight** based on the action’s impact |
| **Chat Only** | goose **only engages in chat**, with no extension use or file modifications | Users who prefer a **conversational AI experience** for analysis, writing, and reasoning tasks without automation |

:::warning
`Autonomous Mode` is applied by default.

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

  :::info
  In manual and smart approval modes, you will see "Allow" and "Deny" buttons in your session windows during tool calls. 
  goose will only ask for permission for tools that it deems are 'write' tools, e.g. any 'text editor write', 'text editor edit', 'bash - rm, cp, mv' commands. 
  
  Read/write approval makes best effort attempt at classifying read or write tools. This is interpreted by your LLM provider.
